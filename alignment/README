To run an example, do `bash build_gentle.sh`

If build is successful, try the following commands (files are also stored here for convenience)

wget https://aacapps.com/lamp/sound/eric.mp3
echo "Hi, I'm Eric, one of the available high quality text to speech voices. Select download now to install my voice." >> eric.txt
python gentle/align.py eric.mp3 eric.txt > out.json
