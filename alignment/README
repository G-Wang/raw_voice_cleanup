The full run_alignment.sh needs 2 directories, "raw_txt" and "wav", where fname.wav and fname.txt are matched pairs of audio, text content

It will run over all files, collecting word statistics and helping do some common cleanup. This was tested on a scraped dataset of political speeches, so it may not generalize to other data.

`bash -x run_alignment.sh` is recommended to see intermediate activity.

To run an example of just one alignment instead, do `bash build_gentle.sh`

If build is successful, try the following commands (files are also stored here for convenience)

wget https://aacapps.com/lamp/sound/eric.mp3
echo "Hi, I'm Eric, one of the available high quality text to speech voices. Select download now to install my voice." >> eric.txt
python gentle/align.py eric.mp3 eric.txt > out.json
